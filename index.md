# About
Robotics geek, and entrepreneur, distance runner.  I am passionate about learning new things and exploring new opportunities.  When not working on cool projects or mentoring several FIRST robotics teams, I can often be found running trails, exploring the great outdoors, or learning something new.  As a student tackling a double major in Robotics Engineering and Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute I also mange to find time to learn new skills and explore interests in visual arts.

# Personal Mission
To work on awesome robotics projects that expand my capabilities, that matter to the rest of the world, and improve people's lives.  I am energized by helping others learn and grow, and am motivated to work on projects that make a positive difference in the world.
